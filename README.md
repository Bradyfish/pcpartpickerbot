# pcpartpickerbot
Hello! I'll update this readme later with more information, but this is a bot created for Discord's Hack Week.
The goal is to create a bot that allows you to access pcpartpicker stats, prices, builds, etc. all from discord!

Some background about myself, I'm a 16-yo high school student who codes in his spare time. I decided to create this bot using python/discord.py because I'm most comfortable with python.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to ask me any questions!

Have an awesome day!
